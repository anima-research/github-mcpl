/**
 * Polling ingress (§Ingress, as amended by contract
 * amendment 1).
 *
 * The contract's first draft polled `GET /notifications`; an App installation
 * token cannot read that endpoint, so the fallback asks the repository what
 * changed since its cursor instead — `listIssuesSince`,
 * `listIssueCommentsSince`, `listReviewCommentsSince` — and derives the check
 * state of the open pull-request heads it saw from `getCheckRuns`.
 *
 * Two properties the acceptance criteria name, and where they live:
 *
 *   - **The interval floor.** `effectiveIntervalMs` is never below
 *     `MIN_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (60 s) and never below GITHUB_POLL_INTERVAL_MS;
 *     a server-sent `X-Poll-Interval` can only raise it, through
 *     {@link Poller.observePollInterval}.
 *   - **Record only after delivery.** The dedup ring is read once per pass
 *     and a key is written back only once its event has been handed to the
 *     listener without throwing, so a failed delivery is re-attempted on the
 *     next pass instead of being silently consumed. The cursor advances for
 *     the same reason: only when the whole pass delivered.
