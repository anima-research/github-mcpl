/**
 * Channels — one MCPL channel per issue or pull request.
 *
 * The contract's channel bullets, and nothing beyond them:
 *
 *   - **Descriptors.** `github:<owner>/<name>#<number>`, type `github`,
 *     `bidirectional`, label `"<owner>/<name>#<number>: <title>"` with the
 *     title bounded to 80 chars, address `{ owner, name, number, kind }`.
 *     The id, label and address all come from types.ts so the format lives in
 *     exactly one place.
 *   - **Lazy registration.** A channel is announced on the first event on a
 *     thread ({@link ChannelRegistry.deliver}) or the first tool touch of one
 *     ({@link ChannelRegistry.ensureChannel}) — never a bulk enumeration of
 *     the repository, which would register every issue a repo ever had. Every
 *     touch of one channel is serialized against the others, so a registration
 *     still in flight cannot swallow what the touch behind it knows. Every
 *     announcement — `channels/register` and `channels/changed` — asks
 *     {@link ChannelRegistryOptions.canRegister} first, so the registry never
 *     exercises a capability the host has not granted.
 *   - **`channels/changed`** when a registered channel's label changes (the
 *     title was edited, or arrived after a title-less tool touch) or when the
 *     thread closes or reopens. What the registry reports is what the host
 *     *acknowledged*: a refused or undelivered update leaves the descriptor
 *     where it was and is retried on the channel's next touch.
 *   - **Incoming.** {@link ChannelRegistry.deliver} takes the outputs of .4
 *     (`tagsFor` → tags + metadata, `renderEvent` → content) and sends one
 *     `channels/incoming` message, with the contract's thread-id rules, after
 *     asking {@link ChannelRegistryOptions.canDeliver} — the registration it
 *     waits behind is a round trip, and the grant can narrow inside it.
 *   - **Publish.** {@link ChannelRegistry.handlePublish} maps a host publish
 *     onto `createComment` or `replyToReviewComment`.
 *   - **Typing.** A no-op that answers success: GitHub has no typing surface.
 *
 * `channels/open`, `channels/close` and `channels/acknowledge` are not
 * declared for this server, so nothing here implements them.
 *
 * The host connection is reached through {@link HostConnection}, a one-method
 * seam this module defines, so .9 can hand in an `McplConnection` and a test
 * can hand in a recorder. Stdout belongs to JSON-RPC; every diagnostic goes
 * through the {@link Logger}, which writes to stderr.
